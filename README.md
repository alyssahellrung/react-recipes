## How I Made This        
I coded along with a tutorial by Dev Ed on YouTube: https://tinyurl.com/4d87wyjz. This application uses async/await to retrieve recipe information from the Edamam API based on search information provided by the user. The Recipe component takes certain information in from the response as props and organizes it, then that information gets passed back up to App.js for rendering.
